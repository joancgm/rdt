## rapid distortion theory for turbulent fluid flow
Calculates the time development of components of Reynolds stresses in wave number space when a uniform mean velocity gradients and/or system rotation are applied. These are integrated to give the Reynolds stresses.
See README.rdt.pdf for more detail.
